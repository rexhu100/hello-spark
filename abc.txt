I
want
to
re-join
as
I
believe
I
was
not
a
good
officer
as
I
promised
I
was
going
to
be
I
went
inactive
and
anyone
who
gave
me
advice
I
took
it
as
a
insult
I
thought
I
was
a
good
officer
back
then
but
now
when
taking
a
step
back
and
seeing
other
officers
doing
there
work
I
know
I
was
never
a
really
good
cop
I
insulted
other
officers
when
they
tried
to
help
me
as
a
police
I'm
not
coming
back
to
make
things
right
for
me
I'm
coming
back
to
continue
my
career
as
a
officer
I
want
to
serve
as
a
loyal
officer
I
know
now
that
I
wasn't
a
good
officer
so
I
want
to
come
back
and
fulfill
what
I
said
I
was
going
to
bring
A
loyal
member
of
the
police
force
I
understand
f
people
don't
want
me
to
come
back
as
a
officer
for
the
way
I
behaved
and
I
understand
that
but
I
want
to
make
things
right
now
and
stay
as
a
member
of
the
police
force
